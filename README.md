This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the RMS Titanic using a machine learning model. The dataset used for this prediction comes from the famous Kaggle Titanic competition. The goal is to build a predictive model that can determine whether a passenger survived the disaster based on features such as age, sex, class, and other relevant information.
